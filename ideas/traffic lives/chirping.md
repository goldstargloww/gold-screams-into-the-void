# once an accident, twice a coincidence, thrice a pattern

i really like leaning into the whole "once an accident, twice a coincidence, thrice a pattern" thing

it's why jimmy doesn't have (back) wings in 3rd life, it's why they're small in last life, and it's why they're fully grown in double life.
- **once an accident** - you don't know how likely this is to repeat, so why would it be the canary curse just yet?
- **twice a coincidence** - 2/2, twice in a row. easy to chalk up to chance, but there's so many others who could've and almost died before you, so what are the chances, really? have they been skewed?
- **thrice a pattern** - thrice in a row. there's a good chance the chances are skewed in favor of your death.

# who notices and who cares

## 3rd life

scott is the only one who notices the birds don't chirp as much because
1. listener aligned and can hear really well
2. he's just generally very perceptive
3. it's jimmy
   1. jimmy is the person scott cares most about in 3rd life
   2. jimmy is the person the server as a whole cares the least about in 3rd life (pretty much)

## last life

the southlands notice in last life because they're in the middle of a forest, and when jimmy dies, it's just martyn and impulse and grian

grian and jimmy are siblings (if not, they're really close friends), impulse just kinda feels like he'd notice, and martyn cares enough about jimmy to have that whole thing in episode 8 happen. scott still cares about jimmy from 3rd life.

they all notice, and scott goes to them and says something, but... none of them really seem to care that much.

## double life

scott notices in double life, but not martyn/grian/impulse, because those three don't really care about jimmy all that much this season.

grian was actively trying to keep him away from the horns the whole time, impulse was actively trying to break everyone up, martyn was actively being picked on by everyone but especially jimmy and tango for the broken heart bastion.

scott... *still* cares about jimmy. he kinda misses him, honestly. i mean don't get him wrong, cleo's great, but things were a lot more simple back in 3rd life, and scott associated jimmy with 3rd life and its simplicity. everyone was just kinda blissfully ignorant about what they were getting into. now, in double life, everything's really messy. like. really messy.

scott goes to cleo because she's really the closest friend he has. cleo is sympathetic, but.. can't really care as much as scott does.

## limited life

in limited life, scott, grian, and joel all notice.

scott still misses jimmy, but he's learned by now that this is inevitable. plus, jimmy doesn't really care about him all that much anymore, does he?

grian doesn't really care all that much. he doesn't mind the silence (or, he tells himself he doesn't), and anyway, grian was trying to get jimmy out of the bad boys from the start, and he's already starting to abandon them at this point.

joel cares a lot, though. he was going to sacrifice himself for jimmy. now that he's learned what that eerie silence is, it stands out so much more, and it's just a reminder of how he failed. joel blames himself.
