how it went from 3rd life and blissful ignorance of what's to come and unhealthy relationships, to limited life and knowing roughly what to expect and that it's bad and relatively healthier relationships

# 3rd life

in 3rd life, nobody really knew what they were getting themselves into. they just expected it to be collaborative and fun, trying to help each other survive on limited lives, and trying to avoid the tragedy that is becoming a red life.

but it ended up devolving into chaos and wars, and soon it very much became a competition to be the last one standing no matter the cost. there was war and murder and traps and bloodshed and bloodlust. there was monarchy and corruption and scams and power imbalances and contracts.

but even through it all, they didn't stop caring about each other, and they quickly found out how dangerous that was. the stress of everything put strain on relationships and caring in the first place only hurt them because they were bound to lose everything eventually.

## flower husbands

flower husbands i think was ultimately a pretty good relationship for the circumstances. but they were still flawed

both jimmy and scott were both a bit ignorant about each other's feelings, for example

scott never had much faith in jimmy. he expected him to die and prepared for it, even if said preparations fell through.

## desert duo

desert duo was flawed from the start due to how it *got* its start. grian only became friends with scar because he had a debt to pay off, and he swore his first life to scar.

scar dragged grian around and grian had no choice but to go with, grian watched scar scam everyone and be overly ambitious and all

grian outwardly expressed his exasperation and how he felt about how scar acted, and scar just ignored it, or tried to, at least.

by the time grian finally turned yellow, it was a bit late to leave, and... he didn't *want* to anymore. by that point, he had begun to warm up to scar. started giving into his plans, killing for him, trapping for him, and genuinely enjoying it. he had gotten attached at this point.

even after being betrayed, grian couldn't bring himself to kill scar. scar gave grian a chance to kill him, because scar knew he had been nothing but a burden and annoyance on grian for the entire game.

and even when grian refused, the ghosts still called for death, for a singular winner, for a fist fight to the death.

that whole fight, they were apologizing to each other. grian was apologizing for what he had to do. scar was apologizing for what he had done. scar let grian win, and grian felt terrible about it.

another note: martyn was under the impression that grian was trapped with scar, and as time went on, martyn thought grian had developed stockholm syndrome or similar

## renchantyn

as soon as a power imbalance was introduced, things started going downhill. ren was always an authority over martyn, no matter how close they were

ren asked martyn to behead him, and martyn complied, because he had to. martyn wasn't the same after that.

martyn did everything he could to protect ren and fought to his death three times over for him, and still failed.

# last life

this time, everyone had some idea of what they were getting into. they were more paranoid and distrustful, and for good reason—they saw what went down last season, and this season had the boogeyman, too. even the new members knew what to expect.

## the southlands

this was generally a better relationship for everyone involved, i think

it was a bigger group, so there were more people to rely on instead of just one, which could be problematic at times

the southlands did eventually fall apart due to distrust and betrayal, though

grian turned red, jimmy ran off with a life, martyn was sneaking off to the shadow alliance, impulse and mumbo were paranoid

jimmy and mumbo turned red and tried to turn on martyn and grian, grian killed them both, martyn tried to kill grian, everything had fully fallen apart by that point.

there was a lot of distrust and paranoia, sure, but there was throughout the entire season. overall, the southlands were a pretty good group, at least healthier than flower husbands was for jimmy, than desert duo was for grian, and than renchantyn was for martyn.

none of them were really over their relationships from the season prior, though

## the scottage

pearl and scott were a really good duo i think. they both held their own independently pretty well, and worked really well together

scott and pearl were equals this time

these two were, iirc, the only group to not fall apart to distrust. they avoided each other in the final fight, and when ren killed pearl, scott killed ren.

# double life

## dessert duo

grian had bad expectations as soon as he learned he was paired with scar, he dreaded it. scar didn't find out until the end despite grian sticking by him the entire session.

grian stuck by scar because he saw him as a liability and couldn't even stick to that for long. grian went behind scar's back and took bigb as a secret soulmate

scar knew. scar went around the server, to divorce quartet in particular, advertising ways to hurt your soulmate - cacti, powdered snow, etc.. scar decided that, if grian was going to try and leave him, scar was going to hurt them both out of spite.

this was obviously not a good relationship lmao

but scar tried to find someone in pearl, and grian tried to find someone in bigb

## divorce quartet

### tilly death do us part

scott and pearl were rough at the start due to what happened in the first session, but they got better towards the very end

pearl constantly hurt and bothered scott out of spite, and scott just tried to ignore it and push her away

but by the end, they were forced together, and worked pretty well to be honest.

scott ended up killing himself so pearl could win. and pearl finally forgave him.

it was bad for the majority of the game, but it got a bit better at the very end.

### bad maths

cleo felt betrayed by the fact that martyn didn't go looking for his soulmate at the start, and they were both willing to reconcile 

martyn killed cleo and felt genuinely terrible about it, he knew he made a mistake, he knew he messed up

cleo apologized to martyn for how harsh she was about the first session. martyn didn't apologize for how he didn't look for cleo.

martyn tried to stay on good terms, and cleo was hesitant about it

but towards the end, they were forced together, and actually worked pretty well

they're very similar in how they play and worked really well together. they still lost in the end, but they did good

### martyn & pearl

martyn and pearl were a really good duo for the first session, they worked well together :>

### scott & cleo

scott and cleo were honestly a really good duo. they worked really well together, they play similarly, they act similarly, they felt similarly on a lot of things, and they did really good together

## boat boys

this is like, joel's first ever positive relationship of these death games. so it was at least better than the lack of that which he had the previous two games

## team rancher

team rancher was *really good*

jimmy and tango worked really well together :D

every time that someone else would've teased jimmy for something, tango was just proud of and happy for him. it was better than flower husbands and better than the southlands, it was a healthy relationship :>

# limited life

## clockers

scar genuinely cared about his family here

bdubs was the first teammate scar ever mourned. and i think that says a lot

## bad boys

the bad boys was like, a really good relationship, i think

they didn't fall apart until jimmy and joel died, leaving just grian, which isn't really a group anymore, so he went to join the nosy neighbours

every time they could've fallen apart, they caught it and stopped it, they took a moment to breathe and apologize, and they moved on

this was joel's first proper team, first proper friends, people who stayed with joel for who he was and not out of obligation. jimmy and grian cared about joel because he was joel, they helped him out, they had fun with him, they were his friends

it was a similar deal for jimmy. tango was a bit different—tango was one person and tango was his soulmate, they just happened to work well together. this time, the bad boys found each other and stayed with each other and worked well together. they trusted each other and stayed together even though they didn't have to

grian finally didn't feel trapped by obligation and the paranoia from last life had died down and/or was easier to deal with. he found people he enjoyed and people who enjoyed him in return. he may have treated jimmy a bit like a liability, something he'd done so many times before with scar, but i think the rest makes up for it for the most part

joel was going to sacrifice himself for jimmy, grian tried to sacrifice himself for joel, jimmy made sure the group didn't fall apart—they all really, truly, genuinely cared for each other

## mean gills

martyn and scott work really well together and click really well as well

from the start, they cared for each other a lot, they protected each other, they were always wary of how the other might feel about something

martyn tried his best to protect scott from the entire rest of the server, and scott trusted martyn to kill him instead of the others so the time would go to martyn over anyone else

as soon as scott said people tried to kill him, martyn asked who and went after them without hesitation

scott trusted martyn with secret areas they could share and traps they should avoid and useful information they could use against others and/or to protect themselves with

they were honest with each other and trusted each other with virtually everything and did things in their collective best interest, well, until the end, that is

speaking of the end, they still clearly cared for each other

marytn may not have entirely been himself, but he still killed scott first and fast. dumped lava on him and hit him a few times before scott even got a chance to react.

scott didn't blame him, anyway. he preferred that outcome over others. he wouldn't've had it any other way.
