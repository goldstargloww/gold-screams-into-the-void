# green

## pre southlands

hmm. thinking similar outfit to green red winter but normal headband and stuff

sometimes he probably takes the hoodie off and ties it around his waist, underneath he just has a white short sleeve shirt

## during southlands / pre shadow alliance

same as before but now he has a thing to hold his spyglass like a satchel or smth, and he has matching shoulder armor on his left shoulder with the rest of the southlanders

## during shadow alliance

shadow alliance scarf, just a green scarf lol

he wears the scarf all the time, but only wears the cloak at meetings (he keeps it in the same satchel he keeps his spyglass inâ€”the spyglass is on the outside tho, more like how smth'd be attached to a belt)

shadow eating martyn would probably really start here and only get worse. i don't know what he thinks about it or if he notices at all?

# yellow

scarf changes colors according to his life color

shoulder armor gets more damaged/scratched up? spyglass outside (not lens) is also a bit sratched up

# red

scarf is red now

shoulder armor has a crack in it, maybe he discards of it entirely at some point later on

spyglass lens has a major scratch/minor crack in it at this point. it's pretty useless, but martyn keeps it regardless

shadow eating is at its worst here. it's not *really* bad, it's definitely not over 10% of his body at any point, it's not devastatingly bad, but it's most prominent towards the end

# notes

each failure he has in regards to the shadow (||failing to boogey grian||, for example) makes the shadow eating 'jump ahead' a bit in progress
