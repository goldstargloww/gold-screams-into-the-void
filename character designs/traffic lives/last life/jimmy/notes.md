# last life

jimmy puts his color block hoodie in the southlands nest that he and grian convinced the rest to make :> (mumbo's used to this (hermitcraft). it's been a while for martyn (evo). it's new for impulse personally but he knows it's a thing (hermitcraft). none of them remember their previous servers though)

instead he wears one of scott's jackets, it's a bit big for him because sizing things are weird and jimmy is tall (and he has a white sweatshirt underneath)

matching southlands shoulder armor

keeps a poppy on his belt

has small canary wings on his back :>

even when he's exiled he doesn't remove the shoulder armor

[the birds barely chirp at all after he dies. the southlands and scott are the only ones to notice. scott is the only one who says something.](https://github.com/goldstargloww/gold-screams-into-the-void/blob/main/ideas/traffic%20lives/chirping.md)
