# limited life

okay limited life is actually quite complicated now that i think about it (okay as much as i struggle to pick a favorite season i think i'd say limited life if i had to make the choice hjgkfs i love limited life a lot)

## notes

### no spoilers at all

[i love this clip lol can we acknowledge this clip](<https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxChcuNarkPuLIOEcuzh7FtPrHGkKk7nX3>)

### technically spoilers but nothing too important

so. i'm rewatching some limited life while i'm doing this. and i just wanna point out

i love how c!scott has abandonment issues?? like? a lot?? HFJS?? when martyn comes 'sheepishly wandering in' scott is like "you *abandoned me..* you came to the coral isles and then you *left..*"

like, i know the abadonment issues stems from his origins character. only really remembers being lonely in space and doesn't want to go back to that loneliness, so he tries to make himself as useful as possible so people don't abandon him

but it fits his life series character so well too?? and every character he plays for that matter, i'm starting to think cc!scott has abandonment issues /silly /lh

but okay. scott's origins character taking into account his life series character?? *like?? yes??*

starboy scott. literally. like. yes. i'm not over o!scott lol

i also love how genuinely nervous martyn sounds and acts and *is* when he's coming back to scott. like he genuinely feels really bad about it and if this doesn't work out he has nowhere to go and everyone's already got their own teams and he's kinda relying on this

and then when etho comes, scott asks if he has cows, and before etho even says he doesn't, martyn's already guiltily stepping away because he feels genuinely bad about it. etho compliments the attempt at a kill and martyn's just like hjfhgd..... ([clip](<https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxlefkbBMtJKom2lvMG_ua7TM8RE7Q3zxN>))

also, how scott and martyn essentially bond over being boogey first and panicking and just trying to kill someone. like, scott killed the first person he saw (o7 skizz's limited life), martyn *tried* to drop tnt on ties+scott and failed, then panicked and went for bigb and very nearly died (just to fall in etho's hole in the middle of nowhere and die anyway because he didnt get a chance to heal), and they talk about it and scott's like yeah i understand i don't blame you and martyn's just like ^^""""

i just really like how martyn really shows emotion in traffic lives in general. genuine guilt after the bad maths incident is another good example, martyn's just like "i am in *so much trouble*" and cleo's like "yeah, yeah you are, yeah i know" HJKSFG

## general design things

okay. so yknow in session 2 when martyn came back to scott, and on his way in [he got pricked by a pufferfish](<https://youtu.be/peqXC59_eUs?t=386>)? yeah so i'm taking that and running with it because a lot of people headcanon lml!martyn as a pufferfish and this is a really good excuse to do that

so i think from that point on over the course of session 2 and 3, martyn gets a bit more pufferfishy? any major enough changes happen between deaths

okay hold on im looking up the [wikipedia page for pufferfish](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetraodontidae>)

also, note: martyn doesn't change to a limited life specific skin until session 4, which i'm not sticking with lol

i say that around the tail end of session 2, so when martyn's at around 20 hours, he swaps out his headband for one made of kelp and also has a bit of loose kelp in his hair

the coral sorta just comes with the pufferfishness ig?

i imagine martyn works a bit differently to how actual pufferfish do because i don't think martyn literally puffing up would be very practical?? because like. he would essentially swallow water/air, and that would just. not work with a human, even if you make their stomach really elastic. it just simply wouldnt

i think instead it's more like retractable claws but like everywhere. and theyre just spikes

i don't think they'd do actual damage (for balancing reasons) but they'd probably hurt (damage vs pain, damage is like hp and pain is pain)

it probably triggers similarly to how he freezes in new life. any sudden change in emotion, or spike of emotion in general. like if he's jumpscared he'll get all spiky lol

also his skin would get rougher kinda like callouses ig

and his teeth get sharper (but especially when he turns red)

also. hold on. pufferfish can move their eyes individually. this is funny to me and im giving it to martyn

also! don't forget that his ears are pointy now :> the shadow eating scars aren't there anymore, btw

as for his wings actually... hm. i wanna think he does have wings because suddenly getting rid of them would be weird. but lml martyn with wings feels a bit strange. i guess i'll just get used to it?

now at least he has clothes meant for wings instead of just cutting holes in them like he did in double life lol

## green + yellow

other than all the pufferfish stuff he's pretty much just his normal self lol, back to short sleeve shirt and shorts and sandals

as mentioned before he gets the kelp around the end of session 2, and by the end of session 3 he's got spikes, his skin is rougher, and he can move his eyes individually :>

his ears are pointy and he has honduran bat wings, his clothes are made for them now

just his eye color changes for life indication :glue:

## red

woo big outfit change time

kelp headband is replaced with a red coral crown, the loose kelp in his hair has dried

hair is also always in a braid at this point, scott does the braid since it's a bit too short for martyn to do himself :> (his hair was sometimes braided when he was yellow, maybe once or thrice, but when he's red it pretty much always is)

has a white collared button up shirt with a cool colored black vest over top, the vest has kinda-sleeves. like the sleeves are just like on top of the shoulders and thats it

reddish brown fingerless gloves (but they have finger holes), and the dogwarts banner is around his waist because this man is still not over ren :>>>

long sleeve trousers same color as his vest with boots the same color as his gloves

one of his eyes has a black sclera now
