# limited life

jimmy finally decides to get a new jacket and he looks more like his [normal skin](<https://namemc.com/skin/7e482a83e69ed469>) now, the shirt underneath is also changed to short sleeves (i hc this is because it's summer in lml and its getting a *biiit* too warm)

he probably would be wearing his bandana but it's a bit too warm. maybe he ties it onto one of his tools instead

he doesn't keep a poppy with him anymore. he looked for one at the start out of habit but couldn't find one and gave up pretty quickly

when the bad boys start he gets his glasses and is the only one to wear them properly, ofc

his clothes are honestly basically just a color change. shirt and shoes become black, jacket and trousers become dark cyan, belt is more silvery and therefore more visible and there's also a chain

at the back of the jacket there's the bad boys logo thingy :> 3 hearts (green yellow red) and "bad boys" at the top

[the birds don't chirp anymore after he dies. scott, grian, and joel are the only ones to notice. scott's resigned. grian doesn't care. joel blames himself.](https://github.com/goldstargloww/gold-screams-into-the-void/blob/main/ideas/traffic%20lives/chirping.md)
