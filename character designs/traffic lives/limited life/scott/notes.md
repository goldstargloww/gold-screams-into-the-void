# limited life

he has a poppy in his pocket now. he would say he keeps it out of his hair because of the water, and that *is* part of the reason, but it's also because of how jimmy's drifting further away even tho scott's still not over it :/

## green

so he spawns in fairly normal, kinda looks like how he did in double life. green part of hair, green jacket, heart on shirt, but now he has shorts instead

in session 2 he gets coral on him :>

## yellow

when he turns yellow he gets purpley/bluey scales on him and he has some gills too. jacket and shirt heart and hair strip turn yellow

## red

color thingies turn red and he gets fins in place of his ears, also one of his eyes has a black sclera now
