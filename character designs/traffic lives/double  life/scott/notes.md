# double life

hair has gone to like, between 3rd and last life's lengths, and the color stripe in his hair now glows in the dark

no more wristbands, instead his whole jacket changes color, and his jacket has a hood now - his shirt also has a heart on it if it didnt already before

shoes change to boots

he has red moth antennas now because of pearl, they're smaller than hers but still there

he has a cornflower and a poppy in his hair now :>

his skin sparkles like pearl's does, too

when he's red he wears the hood up
