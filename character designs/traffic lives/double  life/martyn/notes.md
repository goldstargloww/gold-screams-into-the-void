# double life

ears are pointer now and he has small honduran bat wings (basically yellow bat wings but the webbing is more an off white), lil listener-aligned things :>> (as a nod to how last life ended, the post-death conversation, "You're more of a... Listener."

the shadow eating kinda left wounds, and so those get restored and leave a weird scar (like cherri's design)

he's mostly just his normal self right now but looks a bit more like his vtuber design, i actually just really like cherri's design in general for this one

white short sleeve shirt, the green/black vtuber vest, normal black headband, long true fingerless black gloves, etc

hair is long enough to put in a short low ponytail and he probably does that, it also is long enough to half-cover his eyes *(i just really like cherri's design lol she has a lot of good ideas)*

i think he's a bit shaken up by the end of last life and doesn't know how to feel about being left alone by the watchers. like. his last interaction with the watchers ("the shadow" to him) has been them expressing their immense disappointment in him. and then they just go radio silent on him. like. that's kinda terrifying, yeah??

### session 2

and now begins the zombifying process (body horror warning here)

skin starts sorta splitting and leaves the stitch pattern and stuff behind, and as different sections are cut off, some of the sections start dying and turning greener

OOH. also. he gets a stitch mark along his neck. he does not like this. reminds him too much of ren and what he did

i'm thinking martyn isn't fully undead like cleo is normally and instead becomes more, like, half undead (and as a result cleo becomes less undead)

so it's more of a, lower than normal body temperature but there's still some thermoregulation, slower heartbeat, less breathing needed so breaths tend to be more shallow and slow, etc

i imagine that on the more dead sections of skin, they don't have sensation natively, but there is underneath. like, it feels like there's something between the thing youre pressing on and the thing you're pressing withâ€”like, yknow when people get top surgery, their nipples get moved, and so they usually have sensation under the nipple but not with the nipple itself. weird example but best one i could think of

i imagine martyn kinda panics and goes to cleo like "cleo help my body is like dying what" and cleo's just like "my body is becoming more ALIVE whAT"

it's probably done by the end of the session

as for soulmate shared feelings things, they've probably just got physical pain at this point

## yellow

now they start sharing actual wounds :D now both of them get to deal with the aftermath of the bad maths incident :> (the humiliation was bad enough gold why do you do this to me -martyn&) (heheheh)

martyn has a cornflower in his hair now because cleo does. idk if cleo gives him one, if martyn proposes the idea, if martyn notices cleo has cornflowers in her hair and just decides to match, or what, i'll have to figure that out later

i think they start 'sharing' emotions by session 4 or 5 (its more, you can tell it's not your own emotion, but it still influences your emotions), and it gets stronger as time goes on

## red

no big design details here i don't think. i guess it's worth noting that his eyes are the only thing that change color with his lives (at least until i get more ideas because that doesnt really seem like enough)
