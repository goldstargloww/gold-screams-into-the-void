# double life

tango has explosion scars from their first death - jimmy has burn scars from the ranch. you'd assume they're from the same source, they aren't

ok but i really like [cherri's design](<https://64.media.tumblr.com/4410251875907712e637d3ac36b32fad/5ea767a3c25a25bf-d0/s1280x1920/ff3832782f41c1b3c1ccba1b978b02cbee388413.png>) here. so im basing this off that

wings are full size :> twice a coincidence, thrice a pattern :>

he keeps a poppy on his belt but he's not too careful with it. it's lost a petal or two by the end

## green

similar to his last life outfit, but there are some differences - oversized cyan jacket over off white/light gray short sleeved shirt with darker cyan shorts, white and cyan shoes with floofy but not fluffy socks, and true fingerless gloves the same color as his shorts

## yellow + red

soon into the ranch they get matching bandanas of each other's colors around their necks (tango gets blue, jimmy gets red) (kinda like the clingyduo headcanon where tubbo has a red bandana and tommy has a green one)

also, overalls with short sleeved trouser legs

after the ranch burns, jimmy gets burn scars from it and has to replace some patches of his clothes

[the birds don't chirp anymore after he dies. scott is the only one who notices. he only says something to cleo this time.](https://github.com/goldstargloww/gold-screams-into-the-void/blob/main/ideas/traffic%20lives/chirping.md)
