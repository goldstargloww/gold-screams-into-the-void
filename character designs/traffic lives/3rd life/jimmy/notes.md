# 3rd life

okay with jimmy there's a *lot* to say lol

uhh, canary ear wings, at least. he also has like a color block sweatshirt i think? like how heavyhandedhex does it. maybe he also has a darker cool colored jacket (that's open but doesn't zip up at all)

he's honestly just a guy. not at all prepared for a death game. just a guy.

he doesn't have (back) wings yet, but he does have ear wings, which're new for him

he also has a poppy that he keeps in his hair :>

when he turns red his skin goes grayscale and that's about it. other than that his eye color is his life color

the birds don't chirp as much after he dies. scott is the only one who notices.
