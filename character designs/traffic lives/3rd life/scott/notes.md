# 3rd life

i really like cherri's design. but with my own interpretations

so basically his normal skin. some differences though: sleeves aren't rolled up and shoes are darker, maybe boots? also hair is a bit longer like how cherri does it. also. poppy in the hair because yes

his halo looks like its made of crystals as it is by default, and he has a wristband on his right wrist, and those along with his eyes show his life color (not his shirt though)

when jimmy dies maybe he switches from a single flower in his hair to a flower crown?

no big differences between lives besides aforementioned colors
