## pre red winter

pre red winter it's pretty much just his default. hasn't changed much visually since evo. his hair is at its shortest here as well

## red winter

once red winter starts he changes to a hoodie (same design as his normal shirt, but it's less saturated) and long sleeve trousers (and they're a warm black now), and he changes from sandals to boots (will decide later on specifics of the boots)

gloves change to long sleeved and now have 2 holes instead of 5 (one for the thumb, one for the rest. just the other kind of fingerless. true fingerless if you will)

headband changes to the dogwarts flag, basically all red except for the ends which have a white triangle on them (dunno yet if i want it to be \\/ or /\\)

there's also something about him that just feels.. broken. ever since red winter started. what happened to kick off red winter really fucked martyn up. he tries not to let it show but it kinda still has toâ€”there's always just been something off and broken about him ever since. i feel like emotionally perceptive people  like scott would notice this

i like cherri's idea of, like, the shadow eating away at martyn physically. i think i wanna include that
